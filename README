OpenFPGACore

This is a very simple and minimal FPGA that is implemented in CHISEL.
To experiment with this project, you will need to install sbt.

This FPGA core design is not intended to be production quality. Instead it is 
meant as an experiment into open source FPGAs. This project will hopefully be 
useful to those who wish to learn about how FPGAs work, and will also 
hopefully serve as a seed to future open FPGA core work.

An FPGA core is not the same as an FPGA board. FPGA cores are the heart of
FPGA boards, and are one of the more complex parts of the board. The complexity
does not come from the core its self, but in how it is programmed. This 
particular implementation uses look up tables (LUTs), a general routing
table (GRT) and logic squares that are composed of LUTs. Please look at the
documentation for a in-depth explanation of each part.


to build this project and run the unit tests, simply type:

  $ export SBT_OPTS="-Xmx2G -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=2G -Xss2M  -Duser.timezone=GMT"
  $ sbt run
  ** sbt_opts is because the tests are too large for the default memory allocation of sbt **
  
to install sbt on Ubuntu, first download at http://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html
then, extract to your Desktop. finally:

  ** hit ctrl-alt-t **
  $ cd ~/Desktop
  $ sudo mv ./sbt /usr/share/
  ** enter your password **
  $ echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/share/sbt'
  ** restart your computer **
  ** log in, and hit ctrl-alt-t **
  $ sbt
  ** allow sbt to install required items **
  
it is also recommended that you install the scala IDE and the sbt eclipse plugin.
